##Cafeteria Owner: The owner needs complete access of the system. They will add and update stock, create invoices,see all reports and so on.

##Online Customer: A customer who want to place an order online would want to see a menu from which they canplace an order. They would want to see the invoice details and status of their order, but they should not see anythingelse about the system.

##Cafeteria Billing Clerk: The billing clerk is the person taking customer orders directly from the counter. They shouldbe able to create new invoices, print them, and see order status. However they should not be able to modify itemdetails or see reports like Profit & Loss since they should be seen only by the owner.
